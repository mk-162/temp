# Cable Ties & More Dossier

## Overview
Cable Ties & More operates in the "Prosumer" and "Organizational" niche. Unlike the heavy industrial focus of Uline or CTU, their branding and product mix lean towards IT professionals, home office setups, and light commercial use.

## Automated Research Findings

### Key B2B Signals
- **Government/Military Sales:** Explicitly targeted. This suggests they have the necessary SAM/GSA registrations, which is a significant barrier to entry for a new UK entrant.
- **Education Sales:** Targeting "Schools" implies a focus on purchase orders from public institutions.

### Product Mix Strategy
- **Cable Management Focus:** Their name implies "Ties", but "More" is the key. They likely sell raceways, desk organizers, and heat shrink, positioning them as a one-stop-shop for *tidying* rather than just *securing*.
- **Retail Pricing:** Likely higher margins per unit than bulk-focused CTU, as they sell smaller quantities to end-users.

## Strategic Implication
GTSE can compete here by offering "Kits" (e.g., "Home Office Cable Management Kit"). We shouldn't fight them on single-unit raceways immediately due to shipping bulk, but we can beat them on core consumables price.
